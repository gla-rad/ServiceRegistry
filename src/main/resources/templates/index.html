                                    The MCP is a decentralised platform that facilitates
                                    secure and reliable information exchange within the
                                    maritime domain and beyond. "Beyond", because the
                                    maritime world isnâ€™t isolated, but needs to exchange
                                    information with other domains - for instance with
                                    other transport domains. The information exchanged
                                    can be of almost any nature, ranging from private
                                    confidential information between a vessel and the
                                    shore office of the shipowner, to public information
                                    provided by authorities, such as the provision of
                                    navigational warnings.
                                </p>

                                    As a decentralised platform, there is no single entity
                                    operating this. Several organisations are MCP service
                                    providers, and collectively they form the "Maritime
                                    Connectivity Platform".
